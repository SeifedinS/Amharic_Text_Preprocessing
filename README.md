### Date created
I have created this project in 27 March 2021.

### Project Title
Amharic Text Preprocessing

### Description
When the input is given to a natural language processing system, it may occur or be given as a paragraph or paragraphs. This input text needs the tokenization process, i.e. input text to an individual occurrence of a linguistic unit, for further processing [2][37]. The tokenization process may be splitting the input text to sentences and also to words if necessary. In the case of charcter normalization, There are characters in Amharic that have similar roles and are redundant. Characters ሀ, ሐ and ኀ; ሠ and ሰ; አ and ዐ as well as ጸ and ፀ are variants along with their orders. These characters are used interchangeably. To avoid words with the same meaning from being taken as distinct words due to these character variants, we have replaced a set of characters with similar function into a single most frequently used character.
